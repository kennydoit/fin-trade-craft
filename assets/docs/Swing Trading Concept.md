Given your dataset — which is already rich with **OHLCV**, **fundamentals**, **insider transactions**, **commodities**, and **economic indicators** — you’re sitting on exactly the kind of multi-dimensional data that can power a swing trading edge. The next steps will depend on whether you want to go **discretionary with heavy analytics** or **fully systematic**.

Here’s how I’d break it down for **swing trading** (days–weeks hold times):

---

## **1. Define Your Trading Universe**

* **Filter for liquidity & tradability**

  * Daily average volume > 500k shares or \$10M turnover (helps execution without big slippage).
  * Avoid penny stocks unless that’s part of your strategy.
* **Fundamentals-based pre-filter**

  * For long-biased swing trading, favor companies with improving earnings, positive revenue trends, or insider buying.
  * For short-biased trades, look for deteriorating fundamentals, high insider selling, or overextended valuations.
* This will cut your symbol list to something manageable (500–1500 tickers).

---

## **2. Build Feature Sets**

Swing trading thrives on **technical + macro/fundamental confluence**.
Examples:

* **Technical**:

  * Price momentum (ROC, % change over 5–20 days)
  * Moving average crossovers (e.g., 10/50, 20/50)
  * Bollinger Band squeezes or breakouts
  * ATR-based volatility breakouts
* **Fundamental/Macro**:

  * Recent earnings surprises
  * Insider buy/sell ratio (last 30–90 days)
  * Sector/commodity strength (e.g., oil-linked stocks moving with crude)
  * Economic tailwinds (e.g., interest rate trends, CPI impact on sectors)
* **Relative strength**:

  * Stock vs sector ETF performance over the past 10–30 days

---

## **3. Develop Trading Signals**

* Combine factors into **entry conditions**:

  * Example long setup:

    > Price > 50-day MA, RSI(14) between 50–65, insider buying in past 30 days, earnings beat last quarter, relative strength > sector ETF, breakout above 20-day high.
  * Example short setup:

    > Price < 50-day MA, RSI(14) 55–70 but rolling over, insider selling in past 30 days, miss on last earnings, breakdown below 20-day low.
* Consider **scoring models**:

  * Assign points to each bullish/bearish condition and only trade high-score setups.

---

## **4. Backtest and Validate**

* Start with **event-driven backtests** (e.g., using `backtrader`, `vectorbt`, or your own PostgreSQL + Pandas setup).
* Test:

  * Win rate
  * Avg. win / avg. loss ratio
  * Max drawdown
  * CAGR vs benchmark
* Avoid overfitting — test on **rolling time windows** and **out-of-sample data**.

---

## **5. Build Risk & Position Sizing Rules**

* Risk **1–2% of capital per trade**.
* Position sizing can be **volatility-based**:

  * `position_size = risk_per_trade / ATR_stop_distance`
* Always define **stop-loss** and **profit targets** before entering.

---

## **6. Create a Watchlist & Workflow**

Daily routine:

1. **Screen** the database for setups meeting your swing criteria.
2. **Rank** candidates by score.
3. **Plan entries/exits** the night before.
4. Review at market close for next-day orders.

---

## **7. Automate the Pipeline**

* **Data ingestion** — Keep all your OHLCV, fundamentals, and indicators updated daily.
* **Signal generation** — A Python script to run screens & score tickers.
* **Alerts/Integration** — Output watchlists to Google Sheets, Slack, or email.

---

## **8. Go Live in Stages**

* **Paper trade** for a few weeks to iron out execution issues.
* Start with **small capital allocation** (e.g., 5–10% of planned amount).
* Increase size as you confirm the strategy works in live conditions.

---

### Bonus: Alpha-Enhancement Ideas

* Use **sentiment scoring** from news + earnings transcripts.
* Add **options market data** (put/call ratios, unusual volume) for directional cues.
* Track **intermarket relationships** (e.g., copper price movements affecting industrials).

If you’d like, I can **design you a swing trading screening system** that uses your fundamentals, insider transactions, and technical breakouts all in one scoring model, so your watchlist updates automatically each day. That would take your database from “raw data” to “trade-ready signals.”

Do you want me to build that framework for you? It would plug right into your existing data.
