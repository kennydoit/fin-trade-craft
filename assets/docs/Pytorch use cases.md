## ðŸ”¥ High-Impact Use Cases

### 1. ðŸ“ˆ Price and Return Forecasting

**Goals:**
- Predict future prices or returns
- Forecast momentum, reversals, or volatility

**Model Types:**
- `LSTM` / `GRU`: For sequential OHLCV modeling
- `Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)`: Faster alternative to RNNs
- `Transformers`: Self-attention-based long-sequence models (e.g., Informer, Time Series Transformer)

**Features:**
- OHLCV time series (daily, weekly, intraday)
- Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- Lagged returns and volume signals

---

### 2. ðŸ’¼ Fundamental Value Modeling

**Goals:**
- Estimate intrinsic value based on fundamentals
- Generate valuation-based signals

**Model Types:**
- Feedforward neural networks (MLPs)
- Hierarchical models using sector/company groupings
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for firm/sector relationship graphs

**Features:**
- Earnings, revenue, margins, ROE, debt ratios
- Historical quarterly trends
- Sector-relative features

---

### 3. ðŸ§  Multimodal Fusion Models

**Inputs:**
- Time series (price)
- Tabular data (fundamentals)
- Text (news, transcripts)
- Events (insider trades)
- Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., FRED)

**Model Types:**
- Hybrid models: LSTM + BERT + MLP
- Attention-based fusion of latent embeddings
- Late-fusion or joint-embedding pipelines

**Tools:**
- `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention`
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Custom collate functions for multimodal inputs

---

### 4. ðŸ’¬ Sentiment & News Modeling

**Goals:**
- Extract predictive signals from news, filings, or social media

**Model Types:**
- FinBERT for sentence-level sentiment
- CNN/LSTM models on historical sentiment time series

**Data Sources:**
- SEC filings (EDGAR)
- Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance
- Reddit and Twitter

**Features:**
- Sentiment scores
- Event-driven price reactions

---

### 5. ðŸ“Š Regime Detection & Market State Modeling

**Goals:**
- Detect market regimes (bull, bear, volatile)
- Model macro and micro market conditions

**Model Types:**
- Autoencoders or VAEs
- Hidden Markov Models + NNs
- Cluster + LSTM hybrids

---

### 6. ðŸ“‰ Anomaly Detection & Event Prediction

**Goals:**
- Detect major moves, crashes, or earnings surprises

**Model Types:**
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Binary classification networks for event detection
- Ensemble models for rare-event forecasting

**Targets:**
- Volatility spikes
- Earnings beat/miss
- Unusual price action
