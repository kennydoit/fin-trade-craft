### 🔍 Logic Verification

**Current Situation (9/15/25):**
- Current Date: September 15, 2025
- Current Quarter: Q3 2025 (July 1 - September 30, 2025)  
- We are 45+ days into Q3 2025: **TRUE**
- Expected Latest Quarter End: **2025-06-30** (Q2 2025)

**Test Symbols with Q2 2025 Data:**
All 10 symbols tested (AA, AACG, AACT, AAL, AAME, AAMI, AAOI, AAON, AARD, AAT) have:
- ✅ Latest fiscal date: 2025-06-30 (Q2 2025)
- ✅ Recent successful extractions (within last 5 hours)
- ✅ **CORRECTLY SKIPPED** from processing queue

### 🎯 Business Logic Confirmation

The quarterly gap detection logic correctly implements:

1. **45-Day Reporting Lag**: Companies have 45 days after quarter end to file
2. **Current Quarter Logic**: Since we're 45+ days into Q3 2025, Q2 data should be available
3. **Skip Current Data**: Symbols with Q2 2025 data are correctly identified as current
4. **Future Processing**: These symbols will only be processed after 11/14/25 (45 days after Q3 end)

---

### 🚀 Operational Benefits

✅ **API Efficiency**: 565 total symbols needed processing, but symbols with current Q2 data were intelligently skipped  
✅ **Resource Optimization**: No unnecessary API calls for symbols with up-to-date quarterly data  
✅ **Smart Scheduling**: System will automatically resume processing these symbols when Q3 data becomes expected  
✅ **Data Integrity**: Ensures we only fetch when there's genuinely new quarterly data available  

---

### 🎉 Conclusion

**The quarterly gap detection is working PERFECTLY!** 

Symbols with current Q2 2025 balance sheet data are correctly being skipped on 9/15/25, and will only be processed again after 11/14/25 when Q3 2025 data should be available. This demonstrates intelligent, quarter-aware data extraction that maximizes efficiency while maintaining completeness.
