I’d rather not get into the color specifically around what happened in Q1 with purchased products. What I said over time is on average you should think of a flat margin on what we purchase and what we sell.

10414926,10512,DXC,2018Q3,Jonathan Ford,Head of Investor Relations,"Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased you are joining us for the DXC Technology, third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer. The call is being webcast at dxc.com/investorrelations and we posted slides to our website which will accompany the discussion today. Slide two explains that the discussion will include comparisons of our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to our pro forma combined company results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The pro forma results are based on the historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the legacy Enterprise Services business of HPE or HPES, giving effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016. As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, the pro forma combined company results include the results of operations of CSC for the three and nine months ending December 30, 2016 and of HPES for the three and nine months ending October 31, 2016. Slide three and four as our participant, the DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustment to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release, as well as in our supplemental slides. Both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On slide four you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of risk and uncertainties is included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law. And now I’d like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie.",3b74b0dc0dc7a0a3a064dff224a3d7e5,0.5,pass,2025-08-08 17:04:43.004063,2025-08-08 17:05:37.442722

We will continue to focus on vertical industries; we will focus on how people are using this at a high level for things like personalization or multichannel engagement with our customers.

3153008,7287,ALRM,2021Q2,Steve Trundle,President and CEO,"Hey, Sterling. Thus far, knock on wood, we haven’t seen any impact on the service providers' ability to sell and install systems. So it’s probably pretty early. At the moment, we of course, feel some impact in terms of people’s willingness to meet in person, come to events, come to the office, those types of things. So, people are obviously taking a more cautious stance. But it’s probably early, but thus far we haven’t seen any impact. If I would anticipate, depending on how this thing goes, I don’t think any of us know exactly how Delta will unfold. But if we went back to sort of the state that we were in three quarters ago with the pandemic, then we would see businesses probably begin to shutter some of their operations. And we may see some impact on the commercial side, just at the point that we’re feeling like we’ve recovered on commercial.

8144751,1761,MAC,2011Q3,Art Coppola,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure, we’re feeling very good about where we are. The biggest news is that we’re into a second generation of leasing, only 14 or 15 months into – after the grand opening. That’s really a little bit unusual. It’s not unusual to give the opportunity to start doing some releasing within a year or two after a great center opens for business. So for example, when we opened the Queens Center expansion, within a year or two after the opening in the expansion area, we’re already doing some minor recycling because it becomes really obvious to everybody what works really well and what is not working. And the pressure of success essentially causes the replacement of weaker retailers with stronger ones. That’s going to happen on a much grander scale at Santa Monica. The remainder here is that we leased that in the worst of times in my recent memory for the type of retail that it is, which was the spring of 2009. We have three or four major tenants, retailers that I consider major that are in the 10,000 to 25,000 square foot neighborhood that are looking for homes in Santa Monica that are international, global retailers that are not currently here. And several, if not all of them want to be at Santa Monica place. And these are tenants that are accustomed to paying high rents for signature iconic locations that help to further their brand. The names like Uniqlo for example and Topshop are looking in the market and people like that. I’m not saying they are going to end up at Santa Monica place, but it’s the best location in Santa Monica, and they want to be in West LA, and it’s a logical place for them to come. So right now the challenge is really assembling space for them. But again, being a great center, you have some tenants that are doing terrific at Santa Monica Place, some tenants that are not doing the mall average. And so I think that you’re going to see, two years from now believe it or not, the center is not going to look even like what it looks like today. So that’s how dramatic the second generation of leasing is going to be. And I will also tell you anecdotally that the second generation of leasing that I’ve taken a look at generally the rents are anywhere from 50% to 75% higher than the contract rents that are being replaced. So as we’re replacing tenants like Charlotte Russe, which had corporate issues, and people that we did original leases with, like Skechers, those are being replaced with much better names. Skechers is being replaced by Free People, Randy, and then there are some of the bigger names that I mentioned. So the big message is we’re into a second generation of leasing already, and it’s a great second generation of leasing.",e3c9d0479103b16dd998d44a2559c4ee,0.8,pass,2025-08-08 10:23:41.000437,2025-08-08 10:24:06.942145

If it were a pinpoint, sort of bullet point at the target, then it wouldn't be tactical; we'd be driving toward a fixed answer. And if you look back over the past couple years, we've in fact well exceeded the 100% return benchmark, and this year we're on target to meet that. So I don't know that it has any direct implication.

9423745,10755,ELAN,2022Q4,Jeff Simmons,CEO,"Thanks, Todd. Before we take your questions, I'd like to provide our view on why the Elanco Board and team have deep belief and confidence in our future. First, pipeline delivery. Dr. Ellen De Brabander and her team are consistently delivering milestones across the portfolio from research to late-stage development. We are refreshing our pet health OTC portfolio with Advantage and K9 Advantix, as well as Advantage XD for cats. We are launching first-in-class innovation in the vet clinic with Zorbium, Bexacat, soon parvovirus and Experior ramping. In the U.S., we have a path to approval by the first half of 2024 for our broad-spectrum parasiticide, our K9 dermatology products, the JAK1 inhibitor, and the IL-31 monoclonal antibody, and now also Bovaer, as I discussed earlier. Our excitement about Bovaer is enhanced by tangible progress on farmers' ability to monetize environmental sustainability efforts. In 2023, we expect the first carbon credits will be minted for beef producers, which will be proof that farm animal sustainability can transition from strategy to tangible action that can create value for farmers, investors and society as a whole. The next reason for confidence is our focus on reducing operational complexity. With the Bayer system integration going live in April, we're fast approaching one operating environment for our complete portfolio, creating more stability, a better customer experience, and opportunity for more efficiencies. Importantly, it allows us to move past the distraction and the significant associated cash cost pivoting the organization towards driving the portfolio and improving free cash flow generation, as Todd laid out. And finally, we are building a commercial leadership team that will drive our commercial execution and launch excellence as we enter the next era for Elanco. In this first year leading the U.S. pet health business, Bobby Modi has built a data-driven organization, improving capabilities across sales force excellence, pricing, digital engagement, retail marketing and vet clinic targeting. Jose Simas, a nutritionist and our U.S. farm animal leader is growing Elanco's share across the business while helping to shape the industry's future with antibiotic alternatives and game-changing sustainability offerings. Ramiro Cabral, a veterinarian and seasoned international animal health leader has demonstrated his ability to lead across our diverse business outside the U.S. across many geographies, species, and products. And finally, we're pleased to announce we are further enhancing the strength of our commercial leadership team with the addition of Tim Bennington. With his 25 years of industry experience across both farm animal and pet health, Tim will be a great complement to our commercial leaders and our organization broadly. He has led some of the most successful blockbuster launches in our industry and run some of the largest P&Ls in Animal Health. We are confident he will enhance our overall competitiveness as our team prepares for this historic launch window and sustainable growth.

8815119,6403,C,2010Q1,"John C. Gerspach, CPA",Chief Financial Officer,"Let me start with our quarterly results on Slide Two. As you know, results for the first quarter of 2010 include the impact of the adoption of FAS 166, 167 which resulted in the consolidation of certain off balance sheet assets including securitized credit card receivables. Therefore, GAAP results for the first quarter should be compared to managed numbers for prior quarters. In the first quarter we reported revenues of $25.4 billion. Operating expenses were $11.5 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter. Provisions for credit losses, claims and benefits were $8.6 billion consisting primarily of net credit losses of $8.4 billion. Net credit losses were down 16% from the fourth quarter on a comparable basis and we recorded a modest net loan loss reserve release of $53 million in the first quarter. We reported net income of $4.4 billion or earnings per share of $0.15 based on average diluted shares outstanding of $29.3 billion. This $4.4 billion represents the highest quarterly net income since the second quarter of 2007. On Slide Three, we summarize the balance sheet impact of FAS 166, 167. As of January 1, 2010 we consolidated approximately $137 billion of assets and $146 billion of liabilities on to our balance sheet, the majority of which was related to credit card securitizations. This translated to $10 billion of additional risk weighted assets. We also added $13.4 billion to our loan loss reserves which decreased our tangible common equity by $8.4 billion, and in total these adjustments lowered our Tier-1 common ratio by 138 basis points. Importantly, we were able to largely offset the impact on TCE and Tier-1 common during the quarter. On Slide Four, we show the results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp reported $5.1 billion of net income in the first quarter while the loss in Citi Holdings narrowed to $887 million. Both segments benefited from a decline in net credit losses during the first quarter and the net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was partially offset by a net build in Citi Holdings. On Slide Five, we show the results for Citicorp. Excluding CVA, revenues of $18.2 billion were up 17% from the fourth quarter driven primarily by securities and banking. Operating costs declined by 3% to $8.5 billion and net credit losses declined again this quarter by 5% to $3.1 billion. We also recorded a $367 million net loan loss reserve release. Excluding CVA, earnings before taxes almost doubled to $6.9 billion. Now, I’ll turn to the businesses within Citicorp. Slide Six shows results for our North America regional consumer banking business. Revenues were $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up 5% sequentially on a comparable basis. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were up 4% quarter-over-quarter. These results primarily reflect higher mortgage revenues offset by lower deposit volumes and loan balances. Card revenues were $2.5 billion, up 6% versus the prior quarter as pricing actions offset a sequential decline in purchase sales and average receivables. While pricing actions were able to offset the impact of the Card Act in the first quarter, we expect the negative impact of the Card Act to increase as additional changes are implemented during the year. We continue to estimate that Card Act could reduce revenues by a net pre-tax amount of approximately $400 to $600 million this year. Operating expenses of $1.6 billion were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of a litigation reserve in the first quarter, expenses were down slightly. On a comparable basis, net credit losses were up 6% this quarter to $2.2 billion reflecting an expected increase in net credit losses in our branded card business. Slide Seven shows the results of the international regional consumer banking businesses. International revenues of $4.3 billion were flat sequentially. We saw continued growth in investment sales of 11% with improvement in every region and average deposits and total loan balances each grew modestly by 2% in the quarter driven by Asia and Latin America. However, these trends were offset by deposit spread compression as well as seasonally lower card purchase sales. While we experienced some variability in drivers on a sequential basis, year-over-year comparisons remain strong reflecting the continued economic recovery in these regions. Operating expenses were $2.3 billion, down 9% from the prior quarter, and international credit costs were $735 million, down 39% sequentially. Credit costs declined across all regions again in the first quarter with the most significant improvement in Latin America. Turning to securities and banking on Slide Eight, excluding CVA revenues were $7.7 billion, up 48% versus the fourth quarter. The sequential increase in revenues reflects strong growth in our fixed income and equity markets business. Excluding CVA, fixed income market revenues were up 77% to $5.1 billion with widespread growth across rates and currencies, credit products, and securitized products. In equity markets, revenues excluding CVA grew 66% to $1.2 billion this quarter with particular strength in derivatives. In investment banking, revenues declined by roughly $400 million to $1.1 billion as higher debt underwriting revenues were offset by lower equity underwriting fees. The advisory business was down from the fourth quarter on lower completed deal volume. We achieved a number three ranking in announced global M&A in the first quarter with cross-border deals representing approximately 30% of market volume. Citi’s global presence gives us a unique ability to advise clients on these transactions, particularly as an increasing number of deals are taking place in developing markets. Private bank revenues excluding CVA were $496 million in the quarter and in lending we saw a $462 million improvement reflecting lower mark-to-market losses on hedging activity. Operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down modestly versus the fourth quarter and credit costs improved again in the first quarter. Net credit losses were down 50% to $101 million and we recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $169 million. Slide Nine shows the quarterly results of our transaction services business. Transaction services revenues were $2.4 billion in the first quarter, down slightly from last quarter driven by the absence of the fourth quarter gain on the sale of NikkoCiti Trust. Average deposits of $319 billion declined 5% versus the fourth quarter as we targeted a reduction in higher cost deposits and assets under custody declined 2% to $11.8 trillion due to the impact of foreign exchange. Expenses of $1.2 billion in the first quarter were down 5% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, revenues for both TTS and SFS grew in the first quarter by 2% and 5% respectively driven by growth in average deposits of 15%, growth of assets under custody of 12%, and higher client volumes across both businesses. We continue to invest in technology to support our clients. On average we invest roughly $1 billion annually on technology and transaction services to remain on the forefront of client service and product innovation. We show the results for Citi Holdings on Slide 10. Revenues were up 26% to $6.6 billion driven by positive marks in the special asset pools. Operating expenses were down 14% to $2.6 billion. Net credit losses declined 21% to $5.2 billion and the net loan loss reserve build was down 59% to $314 million. Slide 11 shows asset trends in Citi Holdings which ended the quarter with assets of $503 billion. In the first quarter we reduced these assets by $27 billion driven by $14 billion of net organic runoff, $9 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, not including the impact of the Primerica IPO and sale which closed in the second quarter, and $4 billion of net credit losses and net asset marks. However, these reductions were offset by $43 billion of assets which came on balance sheet with the adoption of FAS 166 and 167 mostly related to credit card receivables and student loans. At the end of the first quarter, local consumer lending had $346 billion of assets or over two thirds of Citi Holdings. The special asset pool had $126 billion of assets and brokerage and asset management was the smallest segment with $31 billion of assets primarily related to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. Turning to brokerage and asset management on Slide 12, revenues were up 25% sequentially to $340 million driven by first quarter gains on the sales of Abertis and Colfondos, two pension fund managers in Latin America, and expenses were down 9% sequentially to $265 million as costs associated with Smith Barney declined. Slide 13 shows the local consumer lending segment. Revenues of $4.7 billion were up slightly versus the prior quarter on a comparable basis and operating expenses were down 13% to $2.2 billion. Credit costs improved again in the first quarter. Net credit losses of $4.9 billion were down 14% from the fourth quarter driven by improvements in US mortgages and international consumer credit and our net loan loss reserve build was down 56% to $386 million. Turning to the special asset pool on Slide 14, positive net revenue marks of $1.4 billion drove reported revenues in the first quarter. Operating expenses were down 36% to $131 million and credit costs declined 73% to $227 million driven by a decline in net credit losses. During the quarter, we executed over $6 billion of asset sales. Slide 15 shows the results for the corporate other segment. The sequential improvement in revenues and net income is primarily driven by the absence of $10.1 billion of pre-tax losses associated with TARP repayment and the exit from the loss sharing agreement in the fourth quarter. Assets of $263 billion include approximately $107 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $103 billion of available for sale securities. Slide 16 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and reserve provisions. Net credit losses of $8.4 billion were down 16% versus the prior quarter and we recorded a modest net loan loss reserve release of $53 million versus a net build of $755 million in the fourth quarter. Corporate credit costs were $87 million in the first quarter, down 89% sequentially. Net credit losses were down 66% to $364 million and we recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $277 million. The decline in credit costs reflects continued stabilization in credit quality across most segments of our corporate loan portfolio. Corporate non-accrual loans of $12.9 billion were down 4% versus the fourth quarter. The majority of credit costs are generated by our consumer businesses in regional consumer banking and local consumer lending. Consumer net credit losses of $8 billion declined 10% versus the fourth quarter and the net loan loss reserve build of $224 million was down 78%. Slide 17 shows total Citigroup loan loss reserves. Loan loss reserves were $48.7 billion at the end of the first quarter or 6.8% of total loans. Slide 18 shows consumer credit trends for Citigroup. Net credit losses of $8 billion were down 10% this quarter driven by lower losses in Citi Holdings and our net credit loss ratios declined again this quarter to 6.1%. Our consumer loan loss reserve ratio increased to 7.8% driven by FAS 166, 167 and the resulting consolidation of securitized credit card receivables on our balance sheet. Over 80% of our consumer net credit losses were generated in North America, concentrated in the Citi branded and retail partner card portfolios and in US consumer mortgages. Net credit losses in North America declined 7% to $6.5 billion during the quarter and international net credit losses also improved significantly down 20% to $1.5 billion. Slide 19 shows consumer credit trends in our international markets. Net credit losses and delinquencies were down in the first quarter in every region. In Asia, credit trends in Korea remained stable to improving while India showed the most significant decline in both net credit losses and delinquencies. In Latin America, improving credit trends were driven by Mexico and Brazil. In EMEA, net credit losses and 90 plus day delinquencies improved across nearly all markets and for the international consumer businesses within local consumer lending, net credit losses in 90 plus day delinquencies were also down driven by asset sales in EMEA. Slide 20 shows North America credit trends for Citi branded cards and Citicorp and retail partner cards in Citi Holdings. We continue to see stable to improving credit trends across both portfolios. In Citi branded cards, higher fourth quarter delinquencies created an expected increase in net credit losses of 7% to $2.1 billion. However, dollar delinquencies declined in the first quarter in both early and later stage buckets. On a percentage basis, delinquencies are up in Citi branded cards due to a declining loan balance. In retail partner cards, net credit losses declined for the third consecutive quarter by 2% to $1.9 billion driven by loss mitigation efforts and a declining loan balance. Both early and later stage delinquencies also improved in the first quarter. Slide 21 shows the historical trends for net credit losses and 90 plus day delinquencies in our mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings. Both first and second mortgages experienced lower net credit losses and lower 90 plus day delinquencies in the first quarter. Net credit losses on first mortgages declined 24% to $819 million driven by HAMP loan conversions, an improvement in loan loss severity, and roughly $1 billion of asset sales during the quarter. For second mortgages, net credit losses were down 14% to $851 million driven by roll rate improvement. Slide 22 provides more detail on delinquency trends in first mortgages in Citi Holdings. Total delinquencies were down 15% to $14.3 billion in the first quarter driven by lower delinquencies across all buckets. The most significant drivers of improvement this quarter were asset sales and the impact of HAMP trial mods moving to permanent modification. While we continue to evaluate the impact of HAMP we are somewhat encouraged by our results to date. Through the first quarter we converted over $2 billion of HAMP trial mods in our on-balance sheet portfolio to permanent modifications, with many more borrowers continuing in active trials. Early results indicate that redefault rates are likely to be lower for HAMP modified loans versus non-HAMP programs. Slide 23 shows the delinquency trends for second mortgages in Citi Holdings. Total delinquencies were down 9% to $2.5 billion in the first quarter driven by lower delinquencies in all buckets. However, 30 to 89 day delinquencies have remained fairly stable. Slide 24 summarizes our quarterly asset trends. We ended the quarter at $2 trillion in total assets, up 8% from the fourth quarter primarily driven by the impact of FAS 166, 167. Citi Holdings now represents approximately 25% of our total assets. Our NIM increased by 67 basis points during the quarter. Nearly three quarters of the increase was due to the impact of FAS 166, 167 and the remainder was driven by the absence of interest payments on trust preferred securities repaid in the fourth quarter as well as the deployment of cash into higher yielding investments. Slide 25 shows the trend in our key capital metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our Tier-1 and Tier-1 common ratios were 11.2% and 9.1% respectively, up significantly from year-end, adjusted for FAS 166, 167. So in summary, our first quarter net income of $4.4 billion was the highest for Citigroup since the second quarter of 2007. Strong revenues in our institutional businesses reflect the continued strength of our client franchise. Drivers of our regional consumer banking businesses showed continued growth internationally and losses in Citi Holdings narrowed during the quarter as we continue to reduce these assets. We also demonstrated continued expense discipline across the firm and we benefited both internationally and in North America. Earnings growth contributed to strong capital ratios at period end even after the adoption of 166, 167. Looking forward, I’d like to discuss a few factors which may reflect our results. On the revenue side, while we believe securities and banking first quarter results were largely representative of our core business, the first quarter is historically the strongest period of the year, particularly in fixed income. Additionally, as I mentioned before, Card Act is expected to have an increasingly negative impact on US credit card revenues. Net revenues marks in the special asset pool will continue to be difficult to project. On the cost side, operating expenses may increase in Citicorp going forward as we continue to invest in the business. We will also absorb the cost of the UK bonus tax in the second quarter and of course, credit costs will continue to be a significant driver of earnings performance. In the first quarter, we saw an accelerated decline in international consumer net credit losses, and in North America, the decrease in consumer net credit losses exceeded our initial expectations, mostly due to the improvement in US mortgages. Looking forward, we currently expect consumer net credit losses to continue to modestly improve. Internationally, we expect consumer credit trends to continue to improve at a moderating pace as long as economic recovery in these regions is sustained. In North America, we also expect consumer credit trends to continue to improve based on the stable to improved delinquencies we are seeing in our major portfolios as well as early signs of economic recovery. However, significant uncertainty remains in the US, particularly with regard to employment levels and the risk of future legislative actions. Our consumer loan loss reserve balances will continue to reflect the losses embedded in our portfolio due to underlying credit trends as well as the impact of forbearance programs. That concludes the review of the quarter. However, before I turn it back over to Vikram, let me be clear about one issue that has attracted a lot of attention since Friday. So, let me state the following, Citi is not involved in the matter the SEC announced on Friday. It has been widely reported that the SEC, among other regulators, is conducting an industry-wide investigation into a wide range of subprime-related issues. As we disclosed in our 10K, we are fully cooperating with these investigations and it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. With that, Vikram, now back over to you.",2d961742558557dbd9e0db14057bbb47,0.6,pass,2025-08-08 12:27:47.863946,2025-08-08 12:27:49.469771

I think what we ran into the fourth quarter was because we did see what is generally assumed to be some weakness in corporate travel, there was a little bit more use of OTA options than we had necessarily predicted and what you saw with that was slightly lower pricing in an effort to attract more of that business.

10695059,4543,SHO,2013Q2,Kenneth E. Cruse,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Bryan, and thank you all for joining us today on today's call. I'll start by reviewing our second quarter earnings report and our recent transaction activity. Next, I'll discuss some leading indicators for our portfolio and the industry. And finally, I'll cover our rationale for reinstating cash common dividends. Following my comments, John will discuss our capital investment program and the state of play in the hotel acquisitions market. Marc will then review our operations in detail and specific asset management initiatives. Finally, Bryan will go over our liquidity, balance sheet, and guidance for the third quarter and full year before I wrap up our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. To begin with, our second quarter was in line with guidance. Looking at the various components, our revenue per available room grew by 2.6% over the second quarter 2012, which was at the low end of our guidance range, due primarily to slightly slower-than-expected corporate group trends during the quarter. At the same time, our adjusted EBITDA, adjusted FFO, and adjusted FFO per diluted share all came in at the high end of our guidance range. Our adjusted average daily rate grew by $6.50 to $188.89, while our occupancy declined by 80 basis points to 83%. Our quarterly decline in occupancy was almost solely attributable to renovation displacement at the four hotels in which we were completing major repositioning projects during the first part of the quarter. Excluding the four renovation hotels, our portfolio occupancy grew by 60 basis points to 83.9% in the quarter, which, on a same-store basis, is the highest ever second quarter occupancy level for our portfolio. Our comparable hotel EBITDA margins improved by 10 basis points to 33.1% during the second quarter. Here again, our margin performance was impacted by short-term displacement related to renovations. Excluding the four renovation hotels, our hotel EBITDA margins improved by 80 basis points to 34.7% in Q2 as our operators effectively translated incremental revenues into greater bottom-line profitability through a variety of proactive profit improvement measures. Marc will discuss some of our profit improvement initiatives in greater detail later in the call. Moving on to transactions. Improving the quality and scale of our portfolio while gradually deleveraging our balance sheet has been and remains our core strategic objective. During the quarter, we completed several transactions that helped to advance this objective. On May 1, we acquired the 250-room Hilton New Orleans St. Charles as part of the 1031 like-kind exchange. On May 31, we redeemed all of our 6.45% Series C convertible preferred stock at face value of $100 million. We used cash from our February 2013 common stock offering to fund this redemption. The redemption effectively offset the leverage we took on pursuant to the Boston Park Plaza acquisition, which included the assumption of a $119 million, 4.4% mortgage. On that point, after the quarter end on July 2, we closed on the $250 million acquisition of the Boston Park Plaza hotel. This transaction completed the tax-efficient recycling of proceeds from our sale of non-core assets earlier in the year. During our 2013 period of ownership, we expect the Boston Park Plaza to generate between $8 million and $9.5 million of adjusted EBITDA and between $6.5 million and $8 million of net operating income. I know many of you have questions about our long-term plans for the Boston Park Plaza. While we acquired this 1,053-room hotel as is at an attractive going-in yield, we see broad-ranging opportunities to enhance the competitiveness and value of this well-located asset. Our team has been actively engaged in framing out a comprehensive long-term positioning plan for this hotel, similar to the exercise we undertook when we acquired the hotel that is now the Hyatt Magnificent Mile in Chicago. As we are finalizing the plan now, expect more information on our strategy for the Boston Park Plaza later this year. To give you a better perspective on how both the Boston Park Plaza and the Hilton New Orleans St. Charles fit into our overall portfolio, we've included hotel-level financials and full company pro forma adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share for Q2 and year to date for both 2013 and 2012 in our supplemental disclosures this quarter. I should reiterate that prior ownership recently added 112 keys to the Boston Park Plaza by splitting 112 larger rooms into 224 smaller rooms. As a result, year-over-year RevPAR for this hotel is not comparable and will not be included in our full year comparable hotel RevPAR statistics during 2013. As expected, while the additional rooms will have the effect of reducing the hotel's overall RevPAR, the hotel is on pace to increase total revenue by approximately 6% in 2013. Turning to hotel renovations. Our design and construction team has been very active this year on a broad range of repositioning projects. As of now, the team has completed all of our most disruptive 2013 capital projects. And as expected, we're achieving solid growth from hotels where we've recently completed renovations. For example, in July, our recently renovated hotels achieved average year-over-year RevPAR growth of 9%. We expect these solid post-renovation growth trends to continue during the second half of 2013 and beyond. Speaking of future growth, while we expect macroeconomic factors, such as sequestration, to continue to have an effect on the overall growth rate for lodging, it's important to keep such factors in perspective. The reality is that macro factors have tempered demand for lodging since the current recovery began over 45 months ago. Yet travelers are hitting the road in record numbers and our operators are gradually achieving pricing gains as occupancies are at or above prior peak levels. In short, while certain macroeconomic impediments to growth remain, we are seeing a number of green lights as we look ahead. One of the best leading indicators for our business is group booking productivity, which we define as of all future group room nights booked during a specific period. While corporate group was a bit softer than expected in the second quarter, our second quarter group productivity was very strong. Specifically, our same-store group bookings during the second quarter increased 20% over the second quarter 2012. This is record level group productivity for our portfolio. As a result, our current year group pace or group revenues on the books for the current year is now the strongest it has been over the past 5 years, and our 2014 group pace implies continued growth over 2013. Specifically, while our 2014 group pace was slightly below trend when we last spoke, our 2014 group pace is now up approximately 1.1% over 2013 pace, at the same time last year. To be fair, in isolation, our 1.1% increase in group pace is nothing to write home about. But when considered in the context of the very high occupancy level of our portfolio, we expect that our solid 2014 group base will enhance the business transient pricing power of our hotels as the laws of supply and demand continue to move in our favor. Accordingly, we expect our RevPAR and earnings growth to accelerate in the periods ahead. To illustrate this point, for the month of July, our portfolio's comparable RevPAR grew by approximately 7%. In short, we believe the lodging recovery that began in December of 2009 remains solidly on track. Consistent with our prior comments, we expect continued gradual improvement in lodging industry fundamentals for the next several years albeit at a more gradual rate of recovery than during prior cycles. While we're seeing pockets of new hotel supply in certain of our markets, particularly New York, Chicago, and Washington D.C., the trailing 12 months U.S. lodging demand-to-supply growth rate spread is roughly 2.2% in favor of demand, which is well above historical norms. This is a positive indicator for the health of our industry. As PKF projects sub-2% supply growth through 2015, we expect our industry's positive demand-to-supply ratio to persist for some time. While we do expect the U.S. lodging industry to see gradual increases in new hotel supply over the next 3 to 5 years, given the relatively limited availability of development capital and the material discount to replacement value of most in-place hotels, we believe overall hotel supply will, for the next several years, be meaningfully lower than the levels our industry has experienced during the last cycles. Meanwhile, we do expect to see continued growth in demand for upper upscale hotel rooms as the ongoing rebound in corporate profits and improving consumer and business sentiment continue to fuel a higher rate of travel, especially in the major U.S. markets where we have hotel investments, which brings us to our rationale for the reinstatement of our common dividend. For a variety of good reasons, we've been a staunch holdout on reinstituting cash common dividends thus far during the current recovery. Specifically, while it has been our long-term goal to pay a well-supported stable cash dividend, our strategic objective of improving our portfolio quality and scale while gradually deleveraging our balance sheet has taken precedence over the past several years. While our portfolio of quality and balance sheet objectives remain paramount, we've made very good progress on these fronts over the last several years. As a result of select acquisitions, non-core hotel dispositions and our comprehensive renovation program, our portfolio is well positioned for growth. Additionally, we've materially improved our balance sheet through debt repayments, preferred equity redemptions, and equity-funded investments. In light of our progress on these fronts, we are now reinstating a well-supported quarterly cash dividend on our common shares. Our goal is to pay a base quarterly dividend through all phases of the cycle. Although our dividend rate may change in the future based on changes in our taxable income, risks affecting our business and the overall status of our portfolio and balance sheet initiatives, which I noted all remain paramount. We believe that a $0.05 per quarter dividend in both the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year will satisfy our 2013 distribution requirements as we expect to utilize roughly $43 million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset our taxable income in 2013. In 2014, our taxable income will no longer be offset by NOLs or the distributions may have preferred securities we retired earlier this year. Beginning in 2014, we expect to make base quarterly cash dividends, and we intend to employ an annual year-end distribution to satisfy the balance of our taxable income distribution requirements. The size and nature of our year-end dividends will be determined during the fourth quarter of each year. We believe this approach will enable our investors to benefit from a relatively consistent and predictable quarterly cash dividend and a relatively high one-time annual dividend during the continuation of the growth phase of the lodging cycle. Again, our goal would be to maintain good base dividend support during any future cyclical downturns with our annual dividends flexing based on changes in our operating environment. Clearly, the reinstitution of cash common dividend is a positive milestone for Sunstone. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our capital and investment plans going forward.",546fddc710d774b781b668a3d3d82fb3,0.7,pass,2025-08-08 17:51:49.778442,2025-08-08 17:52:48.893449

2138569,10119,EVLV,2022Q2,Mark Donohue,CFO,"Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to review our results in more detail and then share some thoughts on how we're thinking about the rest of the year. As Peter mentioned, revenue was $9.1 million, up 4% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. This growth was highlighted by a 33% sequential increase in subscription revenue, reflecting the growing emphasis we're making on our pure subscription model. We ended the second quarter with 1,147 contracted subscriptions, up 26% sequentially and 193% year-over-year. TCV was $22.1 million, up 15% sequentially and 111% year-over-year. ARR at the end of the second quarter was $20.9 million, reflecting growth of 25% sequentially and 181% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was a record $66.2 million at the end of the second quarter, up 31% sequentially and 166% year-over-year. RPO reflects the difference between contract value and revenue that has already been recognized for units that have been deployed as of the end of the quarter. We estimate that the gross margin of our current RPO, excluding overhead, is approximately 65%, the benefit of which will accrete to our income statement over time. That does not include the renewal opportunity, which would strengthen that gross margin over time as well. In addition to RPO, we had another $14.7 million of contracted revenue associated with units that had not yet been installed as of June 30, 2022. So in total, we had about $81 million of RPO plus contracted revenue in the backlog at the end of the second quarter, representing growth of approximately 27% sequentially. Gross margin was 6% compared to 16% in the second quarter of last year. As a reminder, our gross margins don't currently reflect the overall business value as we're using two very different accounting treatments between our pure subscription sales and our hardware purchased subscription sales. In the case of pure subscription sales, we're yielding gross margins that align better with the long-term deal economics. Alternatively, with our hardware purchased subscription sales, we recognize the equipment revenue and equipment costs at the beginning of the subscription period in advance of the long-term software subscription benefit. This results in lower gross margins for hardware subscription sales earlier in the life cycle than is typical over the contract period. The combination of these very different accounting treatments has traditionally driven our reported gross margins lower than the value of customer contracts are truly reflecting over time. Going forward, we expect to lead increasingly with our pure subscription offering, which aligns more closely to the SaaS nature of our business model. The Q2 gross margins also reflected a higher mix of single lane systems we sold as we accelerated our presence in the education market and the higher contribution we saw from our channel partners. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $18.2 million compared to $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $6.6 million in the second quarter of last year. This sequential decline in OpEx reflects reductions in ongoing professional services and our continued company-wide focus on cost control. We exited the quarter with 213 employees compared to 196 at March 31, 2022, reflecting a net add of 17 employees. Net loss was $25.7 million compared to $23 million in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted net loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other one-time items, was $17.3 million compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes stock-based compensation and other one-time items as well, was $16.4 million compared to $5.2 million in the second quarter of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and cash equivalents, down about $28 million from the first quarter of 2022. This reflects adjusted net loss of $17 million, as well as several other uses of cash in the period which were timing-related and we expect will benefit us over the next several quarters. The first was an investment we made in finished goods inventory as we continue to prioritize product availability. Our inventory balances increased 55% sequentially to $6 million at June 30, 2022, compared to $3.9 million at March 31, 2022. Another driver was the increase in prepaid deposit balances, primarily related to our contract manufacturing partner, again as we prioritize product availability and lock in hard-to-source components. Prepaid deposits increased by 32% sequentially to $17.7 million at June 30, 2022, from $13.5 million at March 31, 2022. Finally, we saw an uptick in accounts receivable due to the increase in sales as well as our pause in billing activity earlier in Q2 as we migrated to NetSuite for our new ERP system. Our AR balance increased by 42% sequentially to $12.2 million at June 30, 2022, from $8.6 million at March 30, 2022. In total, these three drivers combined to consume approximately $10 million in cash in the second quarter of 2022. We consider all of this to be timing-related and not what we would consider run-rate use of cash going forward. As we shared last quarter, we continue to expect our quarterly cash losses to decrease in the second half of the year as we grow deployments and limit expenses. We are encouraged by our progress during the first half of the year. We believe we are well-positioned to meet our full-year growth plans, and as such, are reaffirming our previous guidance which calls for full-year revenue of between $29 million to $31 million, with the year exiting ARR to more than double to $27 million to $28 million. We expect to end the year with approximately $220 million to $230 million in cash, which reflects increased inventory buildup and deposits for materials to support our growth plans in 2023. It also assumes we're successful in implementing third-party financing to support our rapidly growing pure subscription pricing model. We also expect to pay down our expanding long-term debt of approximately $10 million before the end of 2022. So in summary, we're pleased with our strong results of the second quarter. We're excited about our plans for the back half of the year and the opportunity ahead in 2023. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brian.",8a75406eb8131e10dd54adfb1af4d283,0.7,pass,2025-08-06 19:56:46.275365,2025-08-06 19:56:56.115443

1176016,1897,KDP,2019Q4,Bob Gamgort,Chairman and CEO,"Thanks, Tyson, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. Two years ago, we laid out a bold vision and ambitious financial targets for our new company. We saw significant opportunity to create an organization focused exclusively on beverages of all formats by being the first to combine hot and cold beverages at scale and by harnessing an unrivaled distribution system that can reach nearly all selling outlets using seven different routes to market ranging from direct store delivery to e-commerce. Since the announcement, we successfully combined our two legacy companies uniting nearly 26,000 employees into one forward-looking organization with a common platform and culture. We also delivered financial results that have exceeded our three-year targets, invested in the foundation for long-term sustainable growth, and have elevated our game on corporate responsibility and sustainability. In 2019, we delivered very strong financial performance with underlying net sales growth of 3.2%, adjusted operating income growth of 10%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 17%. Importantly, the sales performance reflected growth from all four segments and in-market performance that remains strong as we grew dollar consumption and gained market share in nearly all of our key categories. Our free cash flow in 2019 was exceptionally strong at $2.4 billion, enabling us to reduce debt by $1.3 billion. As a result, we reduced our management leverage ratio to 4.5 times at year-end compared to 6 times at the July 2018 merger close. The strong free cash flow also enabled us to pay down structured payables by $531 million. In addition to delivering strong and balanced results in 2019, we built a foundation for growth upon which we can drive the business faster and more effectively and prioritized investment opportunities during that year that we are now beginning to activate. Therefore, in 2020, we are investing to drive the top-line and expect net sales growth to accelerate to 3% to 4% while still delivering adjusted diluted EPS growth in the range of 13% to 15%. Taking the midpoint of that range would place us directly in the middle of our EPS merger target of 15% to 17% through the first two years with robust innovation, marketing, and in-store execution driving top-line growth in excess of our merger targets. We will deliver these targets while remaining focused on the key drivers that can create value for our company. We create value in cold beverages by renovating and innovating our brand portfolio to leverage our selling and distribution powerhouse and by partnering with emerging growth brands that offer us access to new segments and clear paths to ownership. Productivity provides funding for continued brand marketing and innovation. In Coffee Systems, we create value by expanding Keurig system household adoption by converting drip consumers to single-serve. Keurig brewer and coffee innovation, combined with effective system marketing, drives that conversion. Unique to Coffee Systems, we share some of the productivity we generate with our partners to lower the price of K-Cup pods at retail, further driving consumer growth while still continuing to expand our margins. Across the enterprise, we drive exceptional free cash flow that enables us to delever and offer shareholder value optionality in the future. As we've said previously, while these concepts are fairly straightforward and simple to understand, when implemented effectively, they are incredibly powerful drivers of value. With that as a backdrop, let me take a few moments to emphasize some of the most important aspects of our 2019 results and highlight the areas of investment in 2020 that will drive the accelerated growth we expect. In 2019, our CSD portfolio expanded retail consumption by more than 3% and grew market share by 60 basis points, with the majority of the portfolio contributing to this growth. In particular, Dr Pepper and Canada Dry posted dollar consumption growth in 2019 of 5% and 6% respectively, fueled by innovation and effective marketing. These results are particularly impressive, given the context of the strong growth these two brands posted in recent years. We continue to invest in innovation and marketing behind our key brands, including the successful Dr Pepper limited time offer of Dark Berry and the second year of the Dr Pepper Fansville campaign, the latter of which drove outsized dollar and volume performance for Dr Pepper during the college football season. New partnerships are also an important element of our growth strategy. For example, we tested A-Shoc in 2019 with beverage entrepreneur Lance Collins, expanding our presence in the energy drink category. A-Shoc was introduced regionally in mid-2019 and is now beginning its national rollout. A-Shoc joined Xyience Energy Drinks which we acquired as part of the Big Red acquisition in 2018. Xyience, while small, continues to post impressive growth. In late 2018, you'll recall that we signed a long-term partnership with Danone to distribute evian water. The launch of this partnership combined with CORE and Bai has made KDP the number two premium water company in the United States, and we continue to see areas to build out our presence and drive future growth. In coffee, K-Cup pods manufactured by KDP were up approximately 4% for the year in IRi U.S. track channels, which, as we have indicated previously, don't capture the accelerated growth we are driving in untracked channels. In 2019, the untracked channels represented about half of the pods we manufacture, and we expect that number to continue to grow. Our pod shipment growth of 9% in 2019 is consistent with the actual growth we are seeing across all channels. The strong performance of our K-Cup pods was driven by new households that we brought onto the Keurig platform. Specifically, in 2019, we expanded the number of U.S. households regularly using a Keurig brewer by approximately 7%, bringing the total number of U.S. households in the Keurig system to around 30 million at year-end, with an additional 3 million households using the Keurig system in Canada. This growth was driven by robust brewer innovation and the Brew The Love marketing campaign featuring James Corden for the third consecutive year. Our most recent brewer innovation, the K-Duo, fills an important need for households that want a single machine that can brew both a single cup and a carafe. K-Duo has been extremely well received by consumers both in terms of units sold and star ratings. Additionally, the long-term agreement with Nestlé announced this morning recognizes the strong partnership we've had with the Starbucks brand for almost a decade. With this agreement in place, along with the long-term master licensing and distribution agreements recently signed with McCafé in the U.S., we have every major branded player within the Keurig system committed for at least the next five years. In 2019, we launched our Drink Well. Do Good. corporate responsibility platform, along with multi-year goals for our supply chain, the environment, health and wellbeing, and communities. A significant area of environmental focus for both the industry and KDP is plastics. In late 2019, in partnership with the ABA and industry peers, we've launched the Every Bottle Back initiative. We are also on track to make every K-Cup pod recyclable this year after reaching this important milestone in Canada last year. Finally, in 2019, we rolled out our KDP values and competencies to the entire organization, uniting all of our employees under one common culture, fostering an environment in which everyone at KDP operates with shared purpose and common goals. As I mentioned upfront, we have good line of sight to delivering sales growth in 2020 above our long-term target range by investing in a number of platforms across the business. Starting with innovation, which we expect to be a meaningful growth driver for this year. In CSD, we plan to support our flagship Dr Pepper brand with the first quarter launch of regular and diet Dr Pepper cream soda, which should drive continued growth for Dr Pepper and increase frequency and volume to the category. Also launching in the first quarter is Canada Dry Bold, which takes the extremely popular and on-trend Canada Dry Ginger Ale and enhances the flavor impact. We are also rolling out our new lineup of 10-pack mini cans behind many of our CSD brands, including Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Sunkist, A&W, and 7-Up. These mini cans are consistent with the consumer trend to enjoy carbonated beverages while controlling portion size and caloric intake. While this format has been a significant driver of category growth, until now, KDP has not had full representation across its brands. For Bai, we are introducing our first flavor innovation behind the brand since it was acquired in 2016, with the introduction of Bing Cherry, rolling out nationwide as we speak. This is just one of many actions we are taking to support the brand this year, and we look forward to sharing additional details during our March 19 webcast. As mentioned previously, A-Shoc energy drinks will roll out nationally in 2020. Also, as you’ve likely seen, we purchased Limitless, a lineup of lightly caffeinated sparkling waters early this year. Not only do we plan to build out distribution of Limitless as the year progresses, but we also have developed flavor innovations that we plan to introduce as well. While starting from a small scale, both A-Shoc and Limitless should be solid contributors to growth in 2020. In coffee, we are in the process of launching our next wave of updated brewers, starting with the K-Slim brewer, which is currently available on keurig.com and will be expanded more broadly over the next few months. The K-Slim brewer features an impressive 46-ounce reservoir, a simple user interface, and is the first reservoir brewer to feature our next-generation Keurig branding and design. We look forward to sharing more brewer innovation with you as the year progresses. All brewer and beverage innovation will be supported by significant marketing investment throughout the year, behind both existing and new campaigns. In 2020, we also have plans for increased investment in our networks. This includes CapEx spend and expense behind new manufacturing facilities we plan to bring online in 2020, including our Spartanburg, South Carolina facility, which once operational will be the largest and lowest-cost K-Cup manufacturing facility anywhere. Also coming online in 2020 is our manufacturing and warehouse facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania, which will produce primarily non-carbonated beverages. Both of these facilities will be significant sources of productivity once they ramp up and will support the future growth of our brands. Investment in our networks also includes improvements in our routes to market, including our company-owned DSD network. We'll elaborate more on this during our webcast in a few weeks, but at a high level, this means investments in sales technology and training for our field teams and the acquisition of select independent distribution territories for incorporation into our company-owned DSD. All of this is to ensure that our retail coverage is as efficient and effective as possible, allowing us to drive maximum value from this important asset. In 2020, we will also continue to geo-diversify our brewer supply footprint across Asia. Additionally, we have established a center of excellence for brewer R&D and supply chain management based in Singapore. This center, which started up in late 2019, locates our teams closer to where our appliances are manufactured, allowing us to move faster and more efficiently. Finally, in 2020, we plan to make investments behind our sustainability initiatives. As you are already aware, all of our K-Cup pods we manufacture will be recyclable by the end of this year. Recyclability has been a large barrier to adoption for many consumers, and we plan to promote this news with stepped-up marketing and in-store support. In 2020, we will also launch our first 100% post-consumer rPET bottle. We look forward to sharing more information about this later in the year. During 2019, we received many questions from you about what a future KDP looks like once we move beyond 2021. You're beginning to see a robust pipeline of growth platforms across multiple segments, combined with a contemporary route to market and supply chain infrastructure, all of which points to a compelling future for our company. Our 2020 outlook represents a year of accelerating growth behind stepped-up investments in our brands, network, and people. Some of these investments will produce returns quickly. For example, the innovation and marketing that we are rolling out is expected to translate into accelerated top-line growth in the coming quarters, while other investments will take a little bit longer to show results. For example, Spartanburg and Allentown will be significant sources of productivity and capacity for our business, although benefits won't start to flow through until after this year. Most importantly, these are all critical investments to drive sustained future growth and value creation starting this year. With that, let me now hand it over to Ozan.",0193f449f334a5de606075b1db900c64,0.9,pass,2025-08-06 16:15:46.818320,2025-08-06 16:15:56.992404

And so they may be over 50% digital, which is closer to the Fortune 500, which is at 70% digital, right? So that’s the opportunity, I think, for us in mid-tier to lead the rest of the market. But you are right, Pfizer and a number of notable others really – I mean they are seeing where the ROI is and they are really thinking about what McKinsey is calling this new operating model, and it is more agile. Agile is what we keep hearing from them. What it really means is bringing together digital marketing as part of that sales force and sales team. And in many ways, the sales team, again, in the mid-tier companies are following the lead of the email marketers rather than the other way around, which is how this industry has worked traditionally.

10358259,3848,ZTS,2015Q1,Paul S. Herendeen,Chief Financial Officer,"It's Paul, and I'll address the cash flow guidance. We're not providing a cash flow forecast or balance sheet details at this time, but we have talked in the past about our goal to enhance asset efficiency. For instance, with the implementation of our global ERP system, SAP, we believe that we can eventually reduce our inventory investment and free up some cash. Additionally, by refining our business and trimming our portfolio, we can also release some cash. We face significant cash demands in the near term. For example, in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. We're still using cash to cover one-time costs related to our separation from Pfizer, which we estimate will be between $180 million and $210 million. We also provided an estimate for the costs of the efficiency initiative that we announced today, along with the early stages of our supply network strategy, which are estimated to be between $300 million and $500 million over the coming years. Furthermore, we have a $400 million debt maturity upcoming next spring and our regular dividend to consider. Thus, we have substantial calls on our cash. We’ve given some guidance regarding share repurchases, indicating that we expect to buy back a total of $100 million worth of shares in the first half of 2015 and that we will continue to acquire shares to offset ongoing dilution from our equity-based compensation plans. I've mentioned before that share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation plans, with the activity in 2017 serving as a baseline. As we generate free cash or more debt capacity, we will adjust our plans accordingly. Regarding the deleveraging question, we have previously mentioned that we have a notional floor for our capital structure of gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA of 2.5x. I want to emphasize that debt will play a permanent role in our capital structure, and we remain committed to responsibly managing our shareholders' capital. Our capital allocation hierarchy prioritizes first our business, second value-generating business development activities, and lastly, transactions and shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases. Therefore, think of that 2.5x as a floor and follow the capital allocation hierarchy I've outlined.

5515324,4548,SHOP,2020Q2,Harley Finkelstein,Chief Operating Officer,"Thanks for the question, Matt. It's Harley here. Look, in terms of our channel strategy, which we've been working on now for years, the idea is we think the future of commerce and retail is going to be everywhere. Shopify plays a more central role in the lives of more than one million merchants on our platform. We need to be the retail operating system, which means we need to make it easy for them to sell anywhere where potential customers may be, whether that's on a place like Pinterest or a social media platform or in a marketplace like Walmart. But it all feeds back to one centralized place where they can manage the entirety of their business.

The neat part, I think, about the Shopify offering is that before Shopify, you had to have 20 different tabs open to manage a multi-channel, omni-channel business. Now you don't.

We acquired American National and American Equity at a pretty meaningful discount to book equity, somewhere in the range of 0.7 to 0.8 book. And we were fortunate to have done that when rates were very low. So we not only acquired for a discount, but we inherited liabilities at very low rates. I think the two things that have changed dramatically, which would maybe give us pause, is today the rate environment is much more normalized. And number two, insurance platforms are now trading at close to two times book. You would have seen some recent transactions. I won't call them out by name, but some recent transactions of scale platforms that have traded much closer to two times book, which just signifies how valuable these are, the demand that is out there for this permanent capital base. I don't think we would be a buyer in that zone. In fact, I know we wouldn't. And then setting that aside, what we have today is outstanding. We have licenses across the U.S. We have distribution capabilities in every major channel in the U.S. We have a pensions business, a retail annuity business, an institutional annuity business, and we have international expansion.

Well, let's start there because there certainly wasn't any programmatic changes that impacted us in Q3 or that we see impacting us in a material way in Q4. So I wouldn't cite any big policy shifts, if you will. If you go back to what I tried to answer with Matt's question, I think, remember, the way the market typically exits a recovery, it tends to be Asia first, and then the West follows, typically North America and then eventually Europe, and I think that's what we're seeing play out now. And then by customer type, and you're right, it does vary a little bit across verticals. But by customer type, we typically see recovery before we see it. We see it in the large end of the market before we see it in the mass market, and that's playing out now. And so it's a little bit tough to predict exactly what our mix will look like at the start of each quarter. We do a pretty good job of it. Last quarter, we think we saw a little more rotation to the larger end of our demand profile, which impacted us on the gross margin line. We think we've got it read fairly accurately for Q4, which is why we talk about the main headwind to operating margin being strictly about the downturn in volume versus other factors. I'd say if you look at our traditional mix, we're very strong in the automotive sector, especially across a whole variety of industrial markets. And the industrial markets themselves tend to involve, not just the big names that we'd all understand, but lots of smaller companies, too. And so we're not seeing all the small companies come back at the same rate we are the large ones. Aerospace and defense in the West has been more steady for us, but that tends to, at times, involve larger programmatic deals as well. So a little bit more color. We think we've got it read well for at least the fourth quarter.",7bedb941b502b3f506cc3b5dc3e1ed86,0.5,pass,2025-08-08 00:09:56.323531,2025-08-08 00:10:37.717841

7507492,1962,KEYS,2020Q1,Ron Nersesian,"Chairman, President, and CEO","Yes. Hi, John. This is Ron. I'm going to give you a little bit of a long answer on this because I figure there's a lot of interest in the effects of the coronavirus. First of all, it's a very unfortunate situation affecting not only China, but we're seeing it obviously in South Korea, Italy, and other countries, including customers around the world. The situation is changing, so here is an up-to-the-minute update, as far as what we know at this point. The first thing I'd like to say is that we have a lot of sales in China, but we do not do much manufacturing at all. Over 99% of our products are not manufactured in China. We do receive about 10% of our parts or a little bit less than 10% of our parts from China, but all of this is built into what our guide is. So, let's talk about our employees. We have 991 people in China and another about 233 non-Keysight workers that help us in sales, support, and research and development. Of those 1,224 workers, luckily none have reported coronavirus cases at all. The other thing that's worthwhile to note is, if you look at Hubei province in Wuhan, they're not a big employment center for us. We have folks in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu in Sichuan Province and Shenzhen primarily, as well as some salespeople that are scattered throughout the rest of China. One third of those people are back at work already as we've opened up offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Shenzhen and the rest, the other 770 folks are working remotely through video conferences, remote support with remote control of instruments and giving daily reports to the sales management. So, we get a daily report on the health status of everyone, the sales funnel and how everybody is doing in order to make sure we're taking care of our customers, as well as our employees. We're working through that same process in other parts of the field or in other regions, but clearly the impact in other regions is smaller and not as big of a center for us. So, let's talk about the business implications as we know it. Last quarter, we guided $1.055 billion in revenue and we delivered $1.141 billion in orders or we delivered $86 million in orders above what we said assuming a book to bill of 1%. Of that $86 million in orders, we shipped $40 million of it. So we actually delivered revenue of $1.095 billion, not $1.055 billion, but the additional $46 million we have in backlog that can help smooth out any timing delays that we would see from the coronavirus. We have guided $1.158 billion, plus or minus $20 million, and we've built in approximately $20 million worth of impact into our guide. The key point though that you should remember is that we have a good backlog situation. We have very differentiated products, and we're very confident at this point that we'll be able to make up any delays that we see in the second half of the year, therefore not affecting Keysight's performance in fiscal year 2020. I hope that helps, John.",e751a43d138ea47037c2af93e5d0dbb9,0.5,pass,2025-08-08 08:34:17.142870,2025-08-08 08:34:48.501784

Free cash flow, high confidence again, because we clearly see the growth coming driven by EBITDA and lower one-time costs.

At the end, the disease pressures remain. Now clearly, people prefer, if you can come up with a vaccine, which literally will help make the animal stronger, prevent diseases; that is a reference. You've got to balance that with cost, you have to balance that with some of the side effects, but we are seeing because of that people look and say in the US, and where both in the poultry and the swine business here, one we are increasing our sales and penetration of certain poultry vaccines and we're seeing customers who historically have now begun to look. We are a very small player, obviously it’s a big potential. On the swine side, the vaccines we sell are known as autogenous. So basically we go out to the farms, we pick up the viruses, we take them back to the lab and we make effectively a custom vaccine. This will never be the largest part of the business because it’s not one size fitting all, it’s more the spoke than it is going to be, I wouldn't say it is not a good example, but just Amazon, but what we do is that the vaccines because they are looking at the viruses on the farms. Yes, they are more expensive, but they also work effectively against the viruses that are on those farms. So we are continuing to see in the changing environment that’s quite effective and we continue to see growth in that business. So that’s our approach. In the US, our poultry vaccine business out of Israel are more general vaccines and we sort of follow the diseases around and we see continued growth in that business. As I said, the Far East is a big opportunity there. The organic pressure, I think is a slow growth. I mean it’s easy to put organic or any kind of label or no label on a bottle on a package, it’s hard to raise animals like that and it is quite expensive. So, yes in the US, yes we will see growth, but still the amount of truly organic poultry in the United States, our estimate is less than 3%, 4%. The amount of animal poultry that’s raised with reduced level of antibiotics is quite high. That could be 60%. In that environment, we do quite well. All right because it’s a combination of MFAs, yes we will see a decline. We will also see an increase in the nutritional specialties, as well as vaccines. So the business we are in is we need, we want to see lots of animals being raised with our products. We continue to be and that’s the goal of our business over the next five years or longer to be totally agnostic of what the animal will use or what the grower will use of our products to raise those animals. As long as they are raising those animals and we have a product available that will let them have, in case of birds or pigs or cattle or dairy that they will have a healthy animal that will produce to its maximum ability whether it is weight gain, product quality, milk production, we won't care, we don't care. That’s how we’re driving our business. So, one, we are in this every month, every quarter category of MFA nutritional specialties, vaccines, believe me if it wasn't for the accounting, I would love to get away from that because we like to look at our businesses and animal health business and not really care what people are buying. We still report that way, but over time it will become less important to us and hopefully to you.",f18e7957ef7448e3500a26a5dd88ed48,0.6,pass,2025-08-06 17:53:36.164281,2025-08-06 17:54:10.795741

We have discussed internally whether there are differences in expenses or implementation costs between smaller and larger deals. The reality is that each transaction is unique regarding expected mortality experience and the assets involved. I previously thought that larger deals might be less competitive due to fewer bidders willing to take on those transactions, but that has not been the case, especially in the last couple of years. We have had significantly more success in the smaller market compared to the larger one. For example, last year, we led the market in this category without any large deals. After the announcement of two major deals, we quickly secured three smaller ones.

2041849,4251,WDC,2024Q2,Wissam Jabre,CFO,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, the success of the strategy we have been executing is reflected in our financial performance. Non-GAAP results in the fiscal second quarter exceeded or were at the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Total revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, up 10% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.69, as strong execution with our broad go-to-market channels benefited Flash ASP and gross margin. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 23% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth is attributed to higher nearline shipments to that of center customers and better nearline pricing. Nearline bit shipments were 67 exabytes, up 23%. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower eSSD bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, HDD cloud revenue increased for the first time in six quarters. Client represented 37% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 2% sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, an increase in Flash ASP was more than offset by a decline in Flash bit shipments. The year-over-year increase was due to higher Flash shipments, primarily driven by client SSD shipments into PC applications, more than offsetting a decline in ASP. Consumer represented 28% of total revenue at $0.8 billion, up 15% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth was primarily due to seasonal strength in Flash bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in Flash bit shipments was partially offset by a decline in Flash ASP, as well as lower HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by business segment. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, growing 7% sequentially, as Flash ASPs increased 10% on a blended basis and 7% on a like-for-like basis, stronger than anticipated entering the quarter. Bit shipments decreased 2% after record shipments in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Flash revenue grew slightly with a 21% increase in bit shipments, offsetting lower prices. HDD revenue was $1.4 billion, increasing 14% sequentially. As total exabyte shipments increased 14%, an average price per unit increased 9% to $122. On a year-over-year basis, HDD revenue declined 6%, while total exabyte shipments increased 2% and average price per unit increased 23%. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 15.5% above the guidance range provided in October and improving 11.4 percentage points sequentially, while declining 1.9 percentage points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher Flash ASPs as we proactively optimized product mix, which more than offset higher than anticipated underutilization charges of $156 million or a 5.1 percentage points headwind. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 7.9%, up 18.2 percentage points sequentially, and down 6.6 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $107 million or a 6.4 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 24.8%, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and 4.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $49 million or a 3.6 percentage point headwind. We continue to tightly manage operating expenses, which were $561 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year, and at the lower end of the guidance range. Operating loss in the quarter was $91 million, which included underutilization charges of $156 million. Fiscal second quarter loss per share was $0.69, inclusive of a $14 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred shares. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was an outflow of $92 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $176 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. The quarter ending inventory was $3.2 billion, declining $281 million from the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased five days to 115 days. The majority of the decline was in Flash, where Flash days of inventory remained at a four-year low. During the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in convertible notes, repurchased $508 million of the outstanding 2024 convertible notes, and paid down $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. Gross debt outstanding was $8.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. We expect to retire the remaining balance of approximately $600 million of the 2024 convertible notes at maturity in February 2024. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion and total liquidity was $4.7 billion, including the undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion; we expect sequential revenue growth to be mainly driven by an increase in HDD; we anticipate Flash revenue to be up slightly as we remain focused on optimizing bit shipments and ASP; we expect gross margin to be between 22% and 24%, which includes HDD underutilization charges of $30 million to $40 million; we expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million with the increase driven by the reinstatement of certain incentive compensation programs as the financial outlook has strengthened. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $95 million. We continue to expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal third quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect earnings per share to be $0.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 330 million shares outstanding. As the financial outlook has improved, we will remain disciplined in executing the business, proactively managing our supply and inventory to meet customer end demand, and controlling capital spending, all with the goal of improving profitability.",62a3cce22e1426ede5b5574d31fa5b00,0.4,pass,2025-08-06 19:32:01.650874,2025-08-06 19:32:24.810416

9675633,2158,MCK,2022Q3,Brian Tyler,CEO,"Thank you, Rachel, and thank everyone for joining us on our call today. Today we reported third quarter fiscal 2022 results, another quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all four segments, reflecting strength in the fundamentals across our businesses. Our focus and execution against our company priorities positions us to consistently generate strong financial results despite the fluidity we continue to see in the macroeconomic environment. Before I discuss the business performance, I would like to just quickly remind everyone of our company priorities we have been sharing with you our strategic transformation to a diversified healthcare services company centered around a set of four enterprise priorities. We believe that execution against these priorities is critical to our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth and we want to reiterate our focus and commitment to each one of them. Our first priority is our people, our teams, and our culture. Through our diversified portfolio of assets and operations, we as a company touch and impact many aspects of health in the healthcare system, including patients embedded in our daily operations is our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all, and our mission of building an impact-driven organization. We've been focused on enabling change in three areas, improving access to healthcare, advancing health equity, and protecting our environment. In the past year, our employees came together and shared countless moments of impact, finding new ways to get involved and contribute. In 2021 alone, we completed more than 26,500 volunteer hours and supported nearly 1,500 charities. I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved so far. And I'm confident in our ability to build a brighter future that in fact, offers greater health outcomes for all. Part of our focus on culture is our continued improvement in diversity and inclusion. We put a particular focus on hiring, developing, and promoting what we call a best talent strategy at McKesson. Recently, we were recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality, the ninth year in a row we've received this honor. Our commitment to diversity and refreshment includes our board of directors. In January, we welcomed James Hinton and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson as new independent directors to our board of directors. Both James and Kathleen have served in multiple senior leadership roles within the healthcare industry. Currently, Jim serves as an operating partner for the private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and prior to that, he held the role of Chief Executive Officer at Baylor Scott & White Health. And Kathleen, most recently held the role of Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resource Officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, where she led the Human Capital Strategy including merger integration and HR transformation through digitization. Their decades of healthcare experience and proven record leading complicated organizations and executive leadership roles will be instrumental to McKesson, and we are excited to welcome them to our board. Additionally, we announced today that Don Knauss has been elected as the next Independent Chairman of our Board, which will go into effect on April 1, following a planned transition led by our current Independent Chair Edward Miller. I want to thank Ed for his years of steady leadership and invaluable contributions as the Independent Chair to McKesson's board of directors. I also want to welcome Don to his new role. He brings deep leadership expertise and shares McKesson's values, culture, strategy, and vision, including his commitment to board diversity; we look forward to his leadership and stewardship. Our next priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. We have a vast scale distribution network and deep expertise in global supply chain management, which have been a critical and foundational part of our long history. We're proud of our operational excellence and our ability to capture efficiency and deliver consistent and high-quality service to our customers while optimizing operating margin. Building off of this core capability, we've been very successful in expanding into new product categories and new adjacent markets like our lab solutions and our government partnership strategies. Our scaled assets and capabilities also enable us to play an integral role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud to serve as a centralized distributor of vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. We've also been working closely with our partners, suppliers, and manufacturers to navigate the complex supply chain system. These relationships have allowed us to continue to provide stability of supply and low costs for our customers. As a result, we've managed through some of the challenges that the market has been seeing. Our third priority is to streamline the business, which includes initiatives like the split-off of Change Healthcare and our strategic intent to fully exit the European region. We recently announced the sale of our Austrian business which was completed on January 31, and we have agreements to sell 10 of the 12 countries where we operate. As a reminder, Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. We continue to work towards the closing of the other pending divestitures. These transactions are the result of our intentional effort to evaluate and assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. We believe that by fully exiting the European region, we'll be able to better focus our human and financial capital into higher growth and higher margin areas, which leads me naturally to our next company priority. The last company priority is our strategic growth pillars, oncology and biopharma services. Over the past few years, we set out to accelerate the growth in these two areas and build out what we refer to as ecosystems. As we shared in our Investor Day in December, these are both large and growing markets that have significant unmet needs and opportunities, and we are tackling some of the most complex problems in the healthcare system with the goal to bring efficiency and benefits to all stakeholders across these ecosystems. In the oncology ecosystem, our growth strategy is centered around our support for the large growing and diversified U.S. oncology network. With the reach of over 1,400 physicians, the U.S. oncology network treats 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S. at one of its 500 sites of service. One of the U.S. oncology network's most important initiatives is its participation in the oncology care model, which is a five-year experimental payment model with the goal of bringing down the cost of cancer. Based on the latest results, the U.S. oncology network practices participating in the program achieved high marks on quality metrics and provided significant cost savings to Medicare. By representing approximately one-fourth of all providers participating in the program, the U.S. oncology network demonstrated its leadership role in transitioning healthcare to a more value-based approach. Building upon our deep reach in the Community Oncology space, we're creating an oncology ecosystem with multifaceted service offerings that are all interconnected. At the center of this connectivity is Ontada, the oncology technology and insights business dedicated to helping advance cancer research and advanced patient care. We recently highlighted this business at our Investor Day. Since its launch in December of 2020, the team has made great progress transforming ideas into reality. Ontada signed two agreements with strategic partners to improve patient outcomes and quality of patient care and it was instrumental in the launch of The MYLUNG consortium, which through real-world research and study provides critical information to improve the patient's journey. Within our biopharma ecosystem, we've built a set of differentiated assets and capabilities, including businesses like RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds, and RxCrossroads. They're combined under the prescription solutions business with a shared goal to improve access, adherence, and affordability of medicines. One of the key customers of our business is biopharma companies; through our scale and interconnected technology network, we provide biopharma a range of commercialization services, and by automating and simplifying the process of prior authorization, we reduce prescription abandonment and provide biopharma access to new patients. Our unique technology capabilities also generate insights into patients' needs and challenges, enabling greater ability to impact patient actions and achieve better outcomes. We support over 650 brands today covering 94% of the therapeutic areas and we're connected to all the major insurance companies and most of the regional payers in the United States. The reach of our network is deep and broad, which is why it's the foundation of our biopharma ecosystem, and we are incredibly excited about the market opportunities it brings. Our progress with each of the company priorities has been truly outstanding and we see the strategies working. The strong conviction in these priorities will be our North Star as we seek to advance and win in the marketplaces as a diversified healthcare services company and to drive long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Now, before I turn to our third quarter results, I want to provide a brief update on the progress made towards a broad resolution of governmental opioid-related claims. To date, 46 states, all five U.S. territories and Washington D.C. have joined the proposed settlement to sign on period for political subdivisions in participating states to join the previously announced Proposed Opioid Settlement Agreement founded on January 26. We have now entered into the evaluation period. The deadline for our decision is February 25, 2022. We continue to work with all parties to bring meaningful relief to affected communities and toward resolutions which will allow us to further focus on the strategic priorities of our business. Now, let me get to the results. We're pleased to report a strong third quarter with total company revenues of $68.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.15 ahead of our expectations. As a result of our performance in the underlying business and the contribution from COVID-19 related items, we're raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $23.55 to $23.95. This is from the previous range of $22.35 to $22.95. The third quarter was another example of the nonlinear nature of the recovery from the pandemic. At the beginning of the quarter, volume and utilization trends were recovering as COVID-19 cases continued to decline across the country. Although we expected a nonlinear recovery trend, emergence in the spread of the Omicron variant in December was unexpected. Since then, we've been closely monitoring its impact. One thing we've learned in the past two years is the resilience of our business and our communities. Regardless of the trajectory of the pandemic, we're confident about our ability to adjust and adapt to support our customers and their patients in these challenging times. Let's turn to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment saw 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and increased specialty volume. Through the third quarter and into January, branded pharmaceutical pricing has tracked in line with our original expectations, and consistent with our experience over the past several years. For generics, we continue to benefit from the success and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE. We have not only the scale, but the procurement expertise to consistently source products at low cost while protecting the integrity and safety of the supply chain. We are also proud of our role in supporting the U.S. government's pandemic response effort, as the vaccine and booster recommendations for various age groups continue to expand and evolve. Through January 31, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 370 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to the International Donation Mission. In January, the U.S. government extended the existing COVID-19 vaccine and distribution contract through July of 2022, which is roughly in line with the first quarter of our fiscal 2023. In prescription technology solutions, the segment had excellent momentum and delivered an 11% increase to segment adjusted operating profit in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we offer a range of commercial services primarily to biopharma companies. This quarter, the growth was led by third-party logistics services and our access, adherence, and affordability solutions, including our access for more patients product. This segment aligns with our focus on developing the biopharma services ecosystem. The market that we're focused on presents many exciting opportunities, and we estimate the total addressable market to be around $15 billion with good growth potential and an attractive margin profile. We are pleased with the financial performance and expect to continue to drive while growing the business. With surging demand and a complex supply chain, our new products are playing an important role in the fight against the pandemic. The dedicated team in med surge is the foundation of our business growth, and we continue to invest to ensure operational continuity and excellence. As it relates to our international segment, we continue to benefit from COVID-19 related programs and our European operations in Canada. Through December, we've distributed over 81 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies. As we look forward to fiscal 2023, I'm most excited about the progress on the four company priorities. Since the rollout of these multi-year strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2019, we've been very focused on execution, making impact, and delivering results. While the pandemic continues to present unknowns, what is certain is that fiscal 2023 will be another year in which we focus on strong execution on strategic advancement. Our continued progress towards these four priorities will be a key driver to our sustainable profit growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder value creation. We continue to focus on the things that matter most to our customers, to our patients, to our employees, and to our shareholders. In closing, we continue to be excited about our future growth prospects as we meet the opportunity as a diversified healthcare services company. We have unique and differentiated assets in oncology and biopharma services with unmatched scale and connectivity. We're strategically positioned to win in these growing markets. Lastly, before I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank our dedicated team, including every one of the 76,000 employees that make up team McKesson. We share a mission to improve healthcare in every setting, and that will be achieved only with the dedication and commitment from our people. For the opportunity to work alongside this amazing team, I continue to be humbled and deeply grateful. Thank you for your time this afternoon.

3486354,6900,CRWD,2023Q2,George Kurtz,President and CEO,"Thank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. The CrowdStrike team delivered a strong second quarter headlined by record net new ARR of $218 million as growth accelerated to 45% year-over-year, record net new customer additions and record non-GAAP operating profit. We achieved several additional milestones in the quarter. Ending ARR grew to $2.14 billion on a 59% year-over-year growth rate. We believe this makes us the second fastest software company reported to reach the $2 billion ARR milestone. Ending ARR for our emerging products grew to $219 million, up 129% year-over-year. This included record-setting net new ARR for both Identity Protection and Humio, and we also achieved record net new ARR for modules deployed in a public cloud. Quarterly revenue exceeded $500 million for the first time. We added over 1,700 net new customers, another first for the company. Gross retention climbed to a new record for the second consecutive quarter, and dollar-based net retention reached its highest level in seven quarters. We achieved these results while also driving record non-GAAP operating profit of $87 million, a 147% increase over Q2 of last year, and growing free cash flow of 84%. As Burt will discuss in a few minutes, we are raising our revenue guidance for the year and remain committed to delivering non-GAAP operating leverage and a 30% or greater free cash flow margin for the year while investing in key initiatives that will further widen the gap between CrowdStrike and the competition. Moving to our markets, the competitive environment remains favorable and our win rates remain consistent. We continue to see strong demand even as organizations responded to macroeconomic conditions. For CrowdStrike, this primarily manifested in the form of increased levels of required approvals on some deals as companies evaluated investment priorities, which can extend the time it takes to close deals. However, cybersecurity is not a discretionary line item. Cybersecurity is a priority for CIOs, CEOs, CFOs and Boards of Directors, and our value proposition resonates strongly with these stakeholders. Deals committed to close in the quarter did close in the quarter, and we entered Q3 with a record pipeline. Over the past several months, I have had many discussions with CIOs, and the message is clear. They are looking to consolidate on a platform like Falcon. They want fewer point products, fewer agents, and technologies that consume fewer resources. They need to reduce complexity and simplify operations in their security and IT stack. Complexity is the enemy of security, efficiency, and total cost of ownership. This business imperative is even more crucial in times when budgets are tightening, which accelerates standardization on trusted platforms that deliver immediate ROI and lower total cost of ownership such as CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform. We believe that with increased scrutiny comes increased opportunity for CrowdStrike over the long term, given the Falcon platform empowers customers to consolidate technologies and achieve better protection with less time, fewer resources, and lower total cost. This differentiates us from others in the market and we believe positions us well for continued success even in the current macro environment. And we are seeing this dynamic in our business as the number one vendor by market share in both IDC’s 2021 worldwide corporate endpoint security and modern endpoint security categories. Customers are increasingly standardizing on the Falcon platform, driving module adoption, greater wallet share, and larger customers, the trademark characteristics of a generational platform. Q2 subscription customers with 5 or more, 6 or more, and 7 or more modules were 59%, 36%, and 20%, respectively. This represents a 70%, 84%, and 105% year-over-year increase in these respective module adoption cohorts. As customers adopt more modules, Falcon is increasingly embedded in their operations and workflows, which we believe leads to higher retention rates and even more opportunities for future expansion. Customer retention is also driven by advanced capabilities built into the platform such as Fusion, our customizable security automation and remediation engine. Utilization of Fusion by customers has continued to increase since its launch. In just 1 year, approximately 35% of our customers now use Fusion workflows. In the quarter, momentum was strong among customers of all sizes from large enterprises to medium-sized businesses and smaller accounts. We believe our diversified customer base adds to our resiliency and our ability to deliver durable ARR growth over the long term. Ending ARR growth from our $1 million or more ARR customers accelerated in Q2 and continued to grow faster than our corporate average. These larger customers are standardizing on Falcon, consolidating vendors and prioritizing expansion projects that represent sizable cross-sell and upsell opportunities that are moving forward even under uncertain macro conditions. We are also seeing increased strength in the public sector, which, in Q2, was driven by record SLED performance and wins within the U.S. federal and international government agencies. To date, 20 of the 37 U.S. states that have CrowdStrike customers, as well as the District of Columbia, have standardized on Falcon. One noteworthy development in Q2 was with the state of New York, which is exclusively using Falcon EDR for the newly established joint security operations center. As part of the shared services initiative, New York’s cities and counties in the program will be protected by Falcon. The JSOC program is designed to house cybersecurity assets for multiple levels of government under 1 roof to protect against attacks across New York’s interconnected network and IT services. We believe this is a model program that other states will look to emulate as their communities grapple with the heightened threat environment and cybersecurity skills gap. The second quarter was also a record quarter for our e-commerce sales engine, which is a key factor in our strategy to efficiently reach and serve the small business community at scale. To further support small businesses, during the quarter, we launched our newest bundle, Falcon Go. This starter package is specifically designed as a landing point for smaller businesses with 100 endpoints or less that may be more price-sensitive and looking to transact through our e-commerce or trial program. We also serve small businesses through the MSSP channel. The Falcon platform empowers MSSPs to stop breaches for their customers, simplify operations, and drive cost efficiencies. MSSPs are a rapidly growing component of our partner ecosystem, with Q2 year-over-year ending ARR increasing more than 150% and a rapidly growing customer base that is excluded from our reported logo metrics. In Q2, we added over 1,700 net new customers, bringing the total number of reported customers that rely on Falcon to protect their business to 19,686, a 51% increase year-over-year. I’m especially proud to announce one of our new customers this quarter included a leading incident response firm that purchased Falcon for their internal use. We are also pleased with our strong module performance across the Falcon platform. I’d like to highlight a few standouts in Q2. First is Falcon Complete, which has continued to gain strong momentum in the market as companies look to address the growing cybersecurity imperative and contend with the cybersecurity skill shortage. Over 1,000 customers have adopted Falcon Complete since the start of the fiscal year. By leveraging the advanced automation in the platform, Falcon Complete offers customers and partners a way to quickly and cost-effectively scale and fortify their cyber defenses with gold standard expertise and technology while lowering their total cost of ownership. As we add modules to the Falcon Complete lineup, customers are standardizing on Complete. An example in Q2 is a payments company that adopted our full suite of Falcon Complete offerings, which includes managed identity and managed cloud workload protection. Next is our emerging product category that solves use cases outside of traditional endpoint protection but are rapidly becoming core in the minds of customers. This category includes our Discover, Spotlight, and Identity Protection modules as well as Humio. We delivered record net new ARR from our emerging products, propelling the ending ARR for this category to $219 million, up 129% year-over-year. Our Identity Protection lineup achieved a record quarter and quickly grew to become the largest contributor to ARR within our emerging category. In Q2, the number of customers subscribing to our Identity Protection modules grew more than 100% quarter-over-quarter driven in part by a new logo attach rate that tripled, with close to 80% of cyber attacks leveraging identity-based tactics to compromise legitimate credentials and use techniques like lateral movement to quickly evade detection. Identity Protection is core to stopping breaches. We see many parallels between this new market and the early days of the EDR market, including a massive greenfield opportunity with an estimated $3.7 billion TAM in calendar year 2022 and a sizable uplift to ASP, which can be north of 30%. With our early and growing momentum, we believe CrowdStrike is well on the way to defining and leading the identity protection category. CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Threat Protection is unique in the industry as it can detect and stop in real-time identity-based attacks. And with one easy-to-deploy agent, the Falcon platform can respond to modern attacks with endpoint, identity, and workload context without the multi-platform complexity and post-processing other solutions require. Humio had a record Q2 as we secured wins across multiple verticals, including financial services, health care, retail, manufacturing, transportation, and professional services. Notable wins included a multinational financial services firm with ingestion requirements of up to 4 terabytes a day that adopted Humio to displace its legacy provider whose query speeds and data ingestion capabilities were inferior, and an IT and security services provider in APAC that is now leveraging Humio as the engine to collect and store security and observability data from its growing customer base. Moving from a module perspective to a deployment environment view, our public cloud business delivered a record Q2 with ending ARR growth accelerating quarter-over-quarter for the second consecutive quarter to reach $174 million. Building on the cloud-native application protection platform or CNAPP capabilities we introduced last quarter, this quarter, we announced new CNAPP capabilities to extend support within AWS Fargate to Amazon’s Elastic Container Service, introduced the first AI-powered indicators of attack, comprehensive fileless attack prevention, and enhanced visibility for cloud intrusions and introduced Falcon OverWatch cloud threat hunting, the first stand-alone cloud threat hunting service for threats originating, operating, or persisting in cloud environments. Cloud is another evolving market where we believe we can significantly expand our share, especially as CIOs look to consolidate vendors and move away from point products. As we discussed last quarter, CrowdStrike’s cloud capabilities stand alone in the market by delivering agent-based and agentless solutions natively from the Falcon platform in a single user interface with a shared data back-end in threat graph. The combination of agent-based and agentless capabilities in the cloud enables pre-run time and run time protection, whereas agentless-only solutions can only offer partial visibility and cannot provide run time security. Taking a moment to summarize and put everything we have shared with you today into context. Customers want a trusted platform that seamlessly unifies endpoint, cloud, identity, and data, redefining what core cybersecurity means. CrowdStrike is leading this replatforming with Falcon, and we see no other competitor with a comparable offering. I believe the CISO of a county on the East Coast said it best, and I quote, it’s hard to remember the days when I didn’t have immediate 24/7 remediation, vulnerability reports on every device, discovery of every asset on my network and a clear understanding of every account login, but I’m never going back. I want to thank each and every CrowdStriker for your passionate focus to make us the best in the business. It is your work that earned CrowdStrike’s recognition as a winner in the Best Security Company category for the 2022 SC Awards U.S. and Falcon XDR as a winner in the Best Emerging Technology category for the SC Awards Europe 2022. Before I turn it over to Burt, I would like to invite our investors and analysts to join us at Falcon in Las Vegas in September. Similar to last year, in conjunction with the event, we will hold an investor briefing featuring conversations with customers, partners, and industry experts. To join in person, please contact our IR team for the registration information. The briefing will also be webcast live on our IR website. With that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results in more detail.",0fc835b27d9f4a2a04a3f5f12b451ec5,0.9,pass,2025-08-07 10:44:44.755623,2025-08-07 10:45:19.562919

During our launch event in Germany, we had over 200 attendees, which clearly demonstrated the demand for Trogarzo. Currently, under lockdown, we are navigating a challenging situation, but we have identified a number of patients. It’s crucial that we reach our objectives. I continuously encourage our team there to do whatever they can during these circumstances. Once things reopen, the identified patients, even if they are currently on the sidelines, will receive treatment. We have a significant number of patients in the early access program, particularly in France, where we are utilizing the temporary utilization approval. This will persist, and we are preparing more patients to start Trogarzo treatment as soon as we can. From a scientific perspective, I am quite pleased with the feedback we are receiving. We have an outstanding team of medical science liaisons in Europe and virologists across various countries including Germany, Spain, and France. I am systematically addressing all scientific aspects as planned. Some countries are currently overwhelmed due to COVID, so there may be delays in our submissions. However, we will increase our momentum as quickly as we can, while also maximizing our early access program before the drug is reimbursed.

Right now, we're not calling any upside on that I mean, as we indicated, we've had good iTero growth. We think that'll continue as we – it's not just about how fast you can sell iTero in China, there's a lot of infrastructure work you have to put in place as far as training and putting things in place to be able to sell through China from an infrastructure standpoint.

7053346,8839,IBM,2020Q1,Patricia Murphy,Vice President of Investor Relations,"Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I want to welcome you to our first quarter 2020 earnings presentation. I’m here with Arvind Krishna, IBM’s Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We’ll post today’s prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the Company’s SEC filings. Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, we’ll focus on constant currency growth adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud, and our geographic performance. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. I’d like to make two other comments regarding this quarter’s presentation. First, consistent with our last two quarters, IBM’s revenue, profit, and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. These adjustments and charges are primarily non-cash. Second, our segment structure for 2020 remains consistent with 2019. So, with the beginning of this year, we realigned a couple of offerings between segments, resulting in very modest adjustments. Our results reflect this realignment, and we’re providing a view of first quarter 2019 on that recast basis in today’s supplemental slides and two years of historical recast data on our website. So, with that, I’ll turn the call over to Arvind.",349af6c6b6f7e877312b3a8da9cbb205,0.1,pass,2025-08-07 22:50:43.218363,2025-08-07 22:51:07.356563
315978,1509,LOPE,2020Q3,Brian Mueller,CEO,"Yes, that's a fascinating aspect. The traditional students and how they are navigating the COVID situation is interesting. We've learned several things in the first few months. One significant takeaway is that students really want to be on campus. You can walk around some universities during the day and hardly see any students because many have transitioned almost entirely to online formats. However, the students aren't going home; they prefer being on campus. Our experience shows that students absolutely want to be there. Initially, we were cautious and wanted them to make decisions based on what was best for them, rather than our revenue needs. So, we took a conservative approach, and 4,900 stayed home. But our focus is on what's going well; students are attending classes. If you walk around our campus during the day, it is bustling with students going in and out of classrooms, laboratories, and dining facilities. We are testing students to identify positive cases, isolating those who test positive, and quarantining those in contact, which is a small number compared to the 18,000 students on campus daily. The positives we have are definitely not due to classroom settings. We are confident of that. Issues arise when students leave campus in the evenings, but we have minimized those. We have exceeded our total number of students by 600 and also surpassed our new enrollment goal. We have found a balance, and we expect the spring semester to be even stronger, with a significant proportion of those 4,900 students planning to return to campus and live in residence halls. I'm hopeful, but we'll see what happens in the next four weeks. Overall, we believe we've established a solid foundation for fall 2021, which could be very promising. Of course, we need a vaccine and better treatments, but we anticipate that happening, and we believe fall 2021 could be incredibly successful for us.",80319ab60f4e6c62494b34c1e8919884,0.8,pass,2025-08-06 13:05:00.070482,2025-08-06 13:05:47.779168

I think one of the important things that it has to be looked at is that in the initial orders from the control boards, there has been a heavy, heavy focus on flower and our anticipation is that over time that will move more and more to oil and to concentrates. Now there is a number of changes that have to happen for that to occur, but we have also gotten into a situation where there is product shortages. And so the control boards are relooking at that decision. And as they relook at that decision and have an increased willingness to stock more oil products, you would see sequential growth on top of that.",edfef7bad056dac00e0a0bc85b8e90ed,0.3,pass,2025-08-07 15:35:57.417220,2025-08-07 15:36:02.069858

387571,4531,SHEN,2021Q2,Jim Volk,CFO,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Please refer to Slide 8 to discuss our financial results for the second quarter. Broadband revenues grew 12.2% to $56.2 million, driven by an increase of $6.3 million or 16.7% in residential and SMB revenue, due primarily from a 20.3% increase in broadband data RGUs. RLEC and other revenue declined $400,000 or 8.8% to $3.7 million, primarily from fewer DSL subscribers and lower government support. Broadband adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter grew $500,000 or 2.5% to $20.3 million from the same period a year ago. The revenue increase of $6.1 million was partially offset by $5.6 million in higher expenses. $3 million of the increase supported the expansion of our Glo Fiber and Beam services, including $1.2 million of compensation, commission expense, $1.1 million of advertising and telemarketing expenses and $700,000 of maintenance and line costs. Software and professional fees increased $1 million due to enhancements to our back office systems. We also incurred a recurring increase in video programming fees totaling $500,000 and a non-recurring increase in franchise and regulatory fees of $500,000. On Slide 9. Tower segment revenues grew 8.3% to $4.6 million, and adjusted OIBDA grew 9.3% to $3 million for the second quarter of 2021, due to an 8.5% growth in tenants. Moving to Slide 10. Consolidated revenues grew 11.7% to $60.7 million in the second quarter of 2021. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter grew 29.6% to $16.3 million. The increases were primarily due to strong Broadband and Tower revenue growth and a 30% decline in corporate expenses. The decline in corporate expenses were due to a combination of lower compensation, legal, and professional fees.",f47d63a72017088bd5aad32b73d02dcb,0.6,pass,2025-08-06 13:19:00.657223,2025-08-06 13:19:53.011048
