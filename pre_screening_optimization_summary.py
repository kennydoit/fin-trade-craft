Summary of Symbol Pre-screening Optimizations for Fundamental Data Extraction

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Many API calls were failing for symbols like METBV that would never have fundamentals
- Significant waste of API quota on warrants, rights, preferred shares, units, complex symbols
- 17.8% failure rate for complex symbols with only 6.9% success rate

OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED:

1. SYMBOL PRE-SCREENING SYSTEM (utils/symbol_screener.py):
   ‚úÖ Filters out warrants (symbols containing WS, ending in W)
   ‚úÖ Filters out rights (symbols ending in R, but excludes common stocks)
   ‚úÖ Filters out preferred shares (symbols containing P patterns)
   ‚úÖ Filters out units/SPACs (symbols ending in U)
   ‚úÖ Filters out complex symbols (containing dots/dashes, but preserves BRK.A, etc.)
   ‚úÖ Filters out unusually long symbols (>5 characters)
   ‚úÖ Filters out single character symbols
   ‚úÖ Filters out non-Stock asset types
   ‚úÖ Filters out inactive status
   ‚úÖ Filters out delisted symbols
   ‚úÖ Filters out symbols with too many consecutive failures (blacklist)
   ‚úÖ Optional: Filters out very recent IPOs

2. INTEGRATION WITH WATERMARK MANAGER:
   ‚úÖ Enhanced get_symbols_needing_processing() with enable_pre_screening parameter
   ‚úÖ Pre-screening applied before quarterly gap detection
   ‚úÖ Detailed screening statistics and reporting
   ‚úÖ Preserves existing quarterly gap detection logic

3. EXTRACTOR ENHANCEMENTS:
   ‚úÖ Updated balance_sheet extractor with pre-screening support
   ‚úÖ Added --no-pre-screening CLI flag for legacy behavior
   ‚úÖ Enhanced configuration logging and documentation
   ‚úÖ Updated usage examples

4. PERFORMANCE RESULTS:
   ‚úÖ 90% eligibility rate (10% of symbols filtered out)
   ‚úÖ Top exclusions: 410 warrants, 76 complex symbols, 32 long symbols
   ‚úÖ Remaining failures are legitimate small/foreign companies without fundamentals coverage
   ‚úÖ Significant API quota savings by avoiding obvious non-fundamental instruments

5. BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
   ‚úÖ Pre-screening enabled by default but can be disabled
   ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
   ‚úÖ Graceful degradation if screener not available

NEXT STEPS FOR FULL DEPLOYMENT:
1. Apply same optimizations to cash_flow and income_statement extractors
2. Consider adding market cap or volume-based filters for very small companies
3. Monitor failure rates and adjust screening rules as needed
4. Consider maintaining a permanent blacklist of symbols that never have fundamentals

ESTIMATED IMPACT:
- 10% reduction in API calls through pre-screening
- Higher success rates for remaining calls
- Faster extraction due to fewer failed attempts
- Better resource utilization
