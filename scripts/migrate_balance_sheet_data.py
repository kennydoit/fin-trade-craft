Balance Sheet Data Migration Script
==================================

One-time migration of balance sheet data from extracted schema to source schema.
This script migrates the 2,489 symbols that have meaningful data in extracted.balance_sheet
but are missing from source.balance_sheet.

WARNING: This is a one-time migration script. Do not include this code in production extractors.
