# Cash Flow Extractor Schema Compliance - COMPLETED

## Summary
The cash flow extractor has been successfully updated to use the `extracted` schema, bringing it into compliance with the balance sheet and earnings extractors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Virtual Environment Activation Script
- ✅ Created `activate_env.bat` in root directory
- Provides easy virtual environment activation via `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

### 2. Schema Migration for Cash Flow Extractor
- ✅ Updated all table references from `cash_flow` to `extracted.cash_flow`
- ✅ Added `create_cash_flow_table()` method for schema-specific table creation
- ✅ Removed dependency on schema initialization
- ✅ Fixed table existence check issues
- ✅ Updated all SQL queries to use extracted schema

### 3. Verification and Testing
- ✅ Successfully tested with 2 NASDAQ symbols (ORIS, ORKA)
- ✅ Loaded 22 records into `extracted.cash_flow` table
- ✅ Confirmed no table exists in public schema (proper cleanup)
- ✅ Restored production configuration (limit=3000 for NYSE)

## Current State

### Schema Compliance Status
- ✅ Balance Sheet Extractor: Uses `extracted.balance_sheet`
- ✅ Earnings Extractor: Uses `extracted.earnings`
- ✅ Cash Flow Extractor: Uses `extracted.cash_flow`

### Ready for Production
All extractors now follow consistent schema organization:
- Raw data processing in `extracted` schema
- Proper table creation and management
- Incremental ETL processing
- Rate limiting and error handling

## Files Modified
1. `activate_env.bat` - NEW: Virtual environment activation script
2. `data_pipeline/extract/extract_cash_flow.py` - UPDATED: Schema compliance
3. `verify_cash_flow_schema.py` - NEW: Verification script

## Usage
```bash
# Activate environment
activate_env.bat

# Run cash flow extractor (production ready)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe data_pipeline/extract/extract_cash_flow.py

# Verify schema
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe verify_cash_flow_schema.py
```

## Schema Organization Complete
All extractors now use the `extracted` schema consistently, providing:
- Clean separation of raw vs processed data
- Consistent table naming conventions
- Proper database organization
- Maintainable ETL pipelines

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND PRODUCTION READY**
